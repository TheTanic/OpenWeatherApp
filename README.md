# OpenWeatherApp

The OpenWeatherApp is a simple android application, which offers the possibility to get the current weather and a forecast for a given position. In addition it saves a history of requests.
It was developed during my studies in Telematiks at the Technical University of Applied Sciences Wildau (3rd Master semester, Modul: Android).
